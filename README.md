# Portfolio!
My Portfolio Website, https://toconnell.info - Flask API + AngularJS

## About
Built primarily to be _a part of_ my portfolio, this simple site is a blog-style AngularJS 1 app with two views (one for users, one for administrators) that uses a basic API to manage authentication, post retrieval, etc.

The API is developed in Flask (python3).

The project contains config files for deployment using NGINX + gunicorn.


# Installation

Some notes on installation intended for my personal use.

## Depends
```
# apt-get install python3-setuptools
# apt-get install python3-pip
# pip3 install pymongo, ConfigParser, flask, flask-cors, gunicorn
```
